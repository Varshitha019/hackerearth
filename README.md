#Micro purchased an array A having N integer values. After playing it for a while, he got bored of it and decided to update value of its element. In one second he can increase value of each array element by 1. He wants each array element's value to become greater than or equal to K. Please help Micro to find out the minimum amount of time it will take, for him to do so.
Input:
First line consists of a single integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case consists of two space separated integers denoting N and K.
Second line of each test case consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A.
Output:
For each test case, print the minimum time in which all array elements will become greater than or equal to K. Print a new line after each test case.

#Frustrated coders 
There are N frustrated coders standing in a circle with a gun in their hands. Each coder has a skill value S[ i ] and he can only kill those coders that have strictly less skill than him. One more thing, all the guns have only 1 bullet. This roulette can take place in any random order. Fortunately, you have the time stone (haaan wo harre wala) and you can see all possible outcomes of this scenario. Find the outcome where the total sum of the remaining coder's skill is minimum. Print this sum.  
Input Format
 The first line contains N the no. of coders The next line contains N  elements where the ith element is theS[ i ] of ith coder.  
Output Format 
Print a single line containing the minimum sum.  
Constraints 1<= N <= 1000000 1<=S[ i ]<=1000
